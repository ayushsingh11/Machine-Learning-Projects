This folder contains my solution for Project 1 of Udacity's Neural Network Foundation Nanodegree Program. In this project, I have learned how to build a pipeline to process user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed. Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I have made important design decisions about the user experience for our app. By completing this lab, I understood the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.
